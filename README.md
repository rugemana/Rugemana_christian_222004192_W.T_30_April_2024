admin use login by using email:chris@gmail.com password:1234
and userlogin by role and as administrator



The project appears to be a device tracking and management system (DDTMS) with user authentication and role-based access control. Here's a summary of how it works:
1.User Authentication: Users can log in using their credentials, likely consisting of email and password.
2.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different users have different roles, such as administrators or regular users. RBAC restricts access to certain features or data based on the user's role.
3.Dashboard: After logging in, users are greeted with a dashboard that displays relevant information based on their role. For example, administrators might see data about all devices and users in the system, while regular users might only see their own account information and borrowed devices.
4.Device Management: The system allows administrators to manage devices, including adding new devices, editing existing ones, and marking devices as borrowed or returned.
5.User Management: Administrators can also manage users, such as adding new users, editing user details, and assigning roles.
6.Borrowing System: Users can borrow devices from the system. Administrators can view borrowed devices and manage borrowing requests.
7.My Account: Users can view and edit their own account information, such as name, email, and password.
8.Modal Windows: The system uses modal windows for actions like adding new devices, editing user details, and confirming actions like borrowing devices.
